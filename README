# Mirror

A utility to monitor a directory and copy any added files/directories to
another directory; to mirror one directory to another.

The added twist is that every so often, copied files will be
queried to make sure they are consistent with the files added to the source
directory.  If consistency is found the original file will be deleted.

This should be useful for copying files as they are generated from one
filesystem to another over a somewhat unreliable connection.


*  One consequence of the design is that the data gets transfered twice;
   once on read and once on write.
